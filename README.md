One week challenge to update YRGOs admission test for future generations. The challenge consist of comming up with a new concept for admission test for one of the following classes: Game programmer, Web developer or UX-designer, we choose the Game programmer class and create a website to present the new idea. Our idea was to zoom out of the idea of admissions test only being the test and focus instead on the experience of coming to Yrgo to do the test with a small modificiation to make the test more fun.

The site was created by [Petter Jakobsson](https://github.com/jaken92) & [Simon LÃ¶vbacka](https://github.com/lovbackan)
